## Freshwater Ecosystem Ecology

I have wide-ranging experiences in aquatic ecology. I have worked on projects spanning carbon and nutrient cycling to plankton community composition using a variety of field, laboratory, and modeling techniques.

## Reservoir Carbon Cycling

Since 2018, I have worked on multiple projects examining the **drivers and variability of dissolved organic matter (DOM)** in drinking water reservoirs.

### PhD Projects

-   Understanding stream DOM exports using hydro-ecological models

-   Spatial patterns of DOM composition and concentration across a reservoir watershed

-   Forecastability of DOM concentrations using high-frequency sensors and meteorological forecasts

-   Effects of variable ice cover on lake metabolism (GPP and ER) in a southern Appalachian reservoir

### Previous Work

-   Undergraduate senior thesis on OC variability using high-frequency sensors and time-series modeling
