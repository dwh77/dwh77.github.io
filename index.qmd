I am a PhD candidate in the Carey Lab at Virginia Tech, specializing in water quality research. My research focuses on carbon cycling in reservoirs and how these change over both spatial and temporal scales using field sampling, analytical techniques, and modeling.

I am passionate about education and have gained experience through laboratory instruction and development of educational modules.
